# auto_differentiation
## Overview

This C++ library implements automatic differentiation (AD) using reverse mode, allowing computation of gradients for mathematical functions efficiently. It includes a custom Tensor class for handling multidimensional data and operations.

## Features

- **Reverse Mode AD**: Efficient computation of gradients by tracing computational graphs in reverse order.
- **Tensor Class**: Custom implementation to manage tensors and perform operations.
- **Supported Operations**: Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) and matrix operations (matrix multiplication).

## Requirements

- C++ compiler with support for C++11 or higher.
- Standard Template Library (STL).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.

## Usage

1. Include the "Tensor.h" header file in your C++ project
2. Create tensors and perform operations
3. See examples provided in the test.cpp file for detailed usage scenarios.
